# The Derek Projects
by... Derek

If you're reading this, that means you're at least somewhat interested in the code I wrote for these dumb little projects of mine. Congratulations, nerd!

This website was originally intended to be a compilation of many programs I've written over the years, but eventually morphed into a "best of" page. There are many programs either I'm not particularly proud of anymore, wouldn't have found a good home in this website, or straight up don't work in their current form. Additionally, it can't really be considered a "portfolio" since I re-wrote most of the code specifically to be put on this website.

Also, since I'm not making any money off this website, I thought I might as well open-source it. All django app folders (except for the Home app) are marked by 3-letter codes. All HTML, CSS, and JS files are named according to their respective app.
